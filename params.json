However, even without existing code, I think a lot of problems are better modeled in Haskell than JavaScript or  other languages. Or you might want to use some existing Haskell libraries.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nLet's put a simple paragraph on the page:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nsample :: React () ()\r\nsample = p_ [ class_ \"style\" ] $ em_ \"Andy Warhol\"\r\n\r\nmain :: IO ()\r\nmain = do\r\n    Just elem <- elemById \"id\"\r\n    render elem sample\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat creates a DOM node on the page that looks like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<p class=\"style\">\r\n    <em>Andy Warhol</em>\r\n</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can make that a little more complicated with some more child nodes.\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nsample :: React () ()\r\nsample = div_ [ class_ \"beautify\" ] $ do\r\n    \"The Velvet Underground\"\r\n\r\n    input_\r\n\r\n    \"Lou Reed\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut of course that input doesn't do anything. Let's change that.\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nsample :: JSString -> React AppKey ()\r\nsample str = div_ $ do\r\n    \"Favorite artist:\"\r\n\r\n    input_ [ onChange (Just . value . target) ]\r\n\r\n    text str\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n\r\n* [Animating Web UI with React and Haskell](http://joelburget.com/react-haskell) (article)\r\n* [Writing a React JS front-end in Haskell](http://begriffs.com/posts/2015-01-12-reactjs-in-haskell.html) (video)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nJordan Walke [sketched out](https://gist.github.com/jordwalke/67819c91df1552009b22) a similar API for OCaml.\r\n\r\nWe should try to adhere to React's [Virtual DOM Terminology](https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/fcb1b6ab493b0c77d589) when possible.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\r\n\r\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/joelburget/react-haskell/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
